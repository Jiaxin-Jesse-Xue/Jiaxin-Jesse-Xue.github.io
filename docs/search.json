    "text": "About Me\nMy name is Jiaxin Xue (薛嘉欣), also known as Jesse. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Human Resource Management at Renmin University of China. I was born and raised in Dongtai, a small coastal city in Jiangsu Province, China.\nMy research centers around two fundamental questions in organizational life:\n\nConstructively: How can employees and leaders interact more effectively to enhance productivity?\nCritically: What potential trade-offs and hidden costs may accompany such efficiency gains?\n\nMore specifically, I study topics such as leadership, time management, emerging workplace trends, and exploitation. I approach these questions with persistence and passion, always driven by a deep curiosity about how people work, lead, and adapt in evolving organizational contexts.\nMethodologically, I’m most experienced with survey and experimental designs, including multilevel and within-person data analysis. I’m also actively exploring qualitative and mixed-method approaches to strengthen the insight and robustness of my future research.\nIn the near future, I hope to join a university where I can continue to grow as both a scholar and an educator. I aspire to be a teacher who not only conducts rigorous, insightful research but also inspires students to think critically and engage meaningfully with the world around them. My goal is to produce research that is both theoretically rich and practically relevant—work that informs management, enhances teaching, and contributes to broader community.\nBeyond academia, I served as Deputy HR Manager for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. I worked there for over a year, extending my master’s program to gain this experience. It was a formative journey—organizing a global event amid the COVID-19 pandemic helped me understand what it means to lead and collaborate under radically different, often competing institutional logics.\nAt heart, I believe the world can be better—more just, more humane, more inspiring. I am a romanticist who values idealism over cynicism, and I see warmth in the human condition, even in organizational life. As the writer Albert Camus once said:\n\n“In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”\n\nThank you for visiting my website. I hope our paths cross—through ideas, conversation, or collaboration."

However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the hazards of this work that entail potential dangers in traffic situations. Drawing on paradox theory, we theorize a typical tension in the daily experiences of food delivery workers, the finance–safety paradox. We examine how this dilemma can be triggered by customer demands that could influence delivery workers’ safety (i.e., safety behavior and driving speed) through altering their finance and safety concerns. Using the experience sampling method, we conducted a 14-day diary study with 117 food delivery workers (1430 observations) in China. The results indicate that daily customer demands increased workers’ daily safety concern when workers perceived stronger algorithmic supervision and fewer algorithmic errors on the focal day. Higher daily safety concern resulted in increased daily safety behavior and lower daily driving speed, while higher daily finance concern enhanced daily driving speed. Our research identifies a key driver of safety risks for gig workers in the food delivery industry, elucidates the role of algorithms in their safety compliance, and broadens our knowledge of how they navigate the salient tension between financial precarity and safety risks.\nJournal: Journal of Organizational Behavior.\n  \nClick the image above to view the full article\n \n\n\n\nAuthorship: Jinghao Zhang, Niannian Dong, Lijing Zhao, Jiaxin Xue, Jia(Jasmine) Hu\nAbstract: Despite abundant research on servant leadership, the existing focus predominantly adopted a between-person approach, without considering the within-person dynamism of servant leadership behavior across time.

However, whether the goal of such practices can be achieved depends on employees’ perception of environmental problems and the way they act. Therefore, it is important to stimulate employees’ pro-environment behaviors through management activities. Building on affective events theory and self-determination theory, we examined the effect of environmentally specific transformational leadership on employees’ pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs), as well as the potential mediating effects of environmental passion and autonomous motivation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 214 employees in China. Structural equation modeling was performed to test the theory-driven models. The results showed that environmentally specific transformational leadership positively predicted employees’ PEBs, and that environmental passion and autonomous motivation mediated this relationship, respectively. Furthermore, multiple-mediating testing results showed that environmental passion and autonomous motivation played sequential mediating roles in the link of environmentally specific transformational leadership to PEBs. This research unveiled environmental passion and autonomous motivation as underlying mechanisms that accounted for the link between transformational leadership and PEBs.\nJournal: Frontiers in Psychology.\n  \nClick the image above to view the full article"
