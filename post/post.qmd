From time to time, I jot down thoughts about life and academia—especially around meaningful moments or turning points. Some of these reflections may be half-baked, overly sentimental, or just me overthinking things (again), but they’re real. Writing them down helps me make peace with the chaos, and maybe—just maybe—these notes will resonate with someone else out there who's also figuring things out one coffee at a time. 

No promises, no preaching. Just small footprints along the way. I genuinely enjoy writing these, because there's no tedious **REVIEW PROCESS** involved—such a joy, haha. So, feel free to read, skim, or laugh.
