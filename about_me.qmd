## About Me

My name is Jiaxin Xue (薛嘉欣), also known as Jesse. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Human Resource Management at Renmin University of China. I was born and raised in Dongtai, a small coastal city in Jiangsu Province, China. 

My research centers around two fundamental questions in organizational life:

- **Constructively**: How can employees and leaders interact more effectively to enhance productivity?
- **Critically**: What potential trade-offs and hidden costs may accompany such efficiency gains?

More specifically, I study topics such as ***leadership***, ***time management***, ***emerging workplace trends***, and ***exploitation***. I approach these questions with persistence and passion, always driven by a deep curiosity about how people work, lead, and adapt in evolving organizational contexts.

Methodologically, I’m most experienced with survey and experimental designs, including multilevel and within-person data analysis. I’m also actively exploring qualitative and mixed-method approaches to strengthen the insight and robustness of my future research.

In the near future, I hope to join a university where I can continue to grow as both a scholar and an educator. I aspire to be a teacher who not only conducts rigorous, insightful research but also inspires students to think critically and engage meaningfully with the world around them. My goal is to produce research that is both theoretically rich and practically relevant—work that informs management, enhances teaching, and contributes to broader community.

Beyond academia, I served as Deputy HR Manager for the **Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics**. I worked there for over a year, extending my master’s program to gain this experience. It was a formative journey—organizing a global event amid the COVID-19 pandemic helped me understand what it means to lead and collaborate under radically different, often competing institutional logics.

At heart, I believe the world can be better—more just, more humane, more inspiring. I am a romanticist who values idealism over cynicism, and I see warmth in the human condition, even in organizational life. As the writer Albert Camus once said:

> *“In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”*

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope our paths cross—through ideas, conversation, or collaboration.
