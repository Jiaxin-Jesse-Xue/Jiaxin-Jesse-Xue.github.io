::: {#hero-heading}

**Hi There!**

My name is Jiaxin Xue (薛嘉欣), also known as Jesse. 

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Human Resource Management at Renmin University of China. My research interests revolve around two fundamental questions in organizational life:

- **Constructively**: How employees and leaders can interact more effectively to enhance productivity?  
- **Critically**: What potential trade-offs and hidden costs may accompany such efficiency gains?

More specifically, my work spans the areas of ***leadership***, ***time management***, ***emerging workplace trends***, and ***exploitation***. 

My research has been published in the journals such as the *Journal of Organizational Behavior*, *Journal of Business Ethics*, *Group & Organization Management*, and *南开管理评论*.

I bring strong passion and persistence to my research, driven by a deep curiosity about how people work, lead, and adapt in evolving organizational contexts.

Beyond academia, I served as Deputy HR Manager during the **Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics**, where I gained valuable practical experience in large-scale event organization and human resource coordination.

A quote that resonates deeply with me comes from *The Doctrine of the Mean (中庸)*:

> *"To love learning is to draw near to wisdom; To act with effort is to draw near to benevolence; To know shame is to draw near to courage (好学近乎知，力行近乎仁，知耻近乎勇)."*
